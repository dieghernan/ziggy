## Ziggy's Dustier Corners

Like most software packages, Ziggy has some features that don't see a lot of use or that only get exercised under unusual circumstances. Those oddballs are documented here.

[More on the Relational Database](more-rdbms.md) -- techically the RDBMS is used all the time, but there are a few details about what we do with it that are potentially interesting to users. 

[Redefining a Parameter Set](redefine-parameter-set.md) -- what to do if you realize that you need to change the parameters in a parameter set.

[Redefining a Pipeline](redefine-pipeline.md) -- what to do if you realize that you need to change the configuration of a pipeline.

[Parameter Overrides](parameter-overrides.md) -- how to conveniently package a collection of parameter changes.

[The Edit Trigger Dialog Box](edit-trigger.md) -- additional features on a dialog box we've already used.
